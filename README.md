# Text-Summarization-with-Seq2seq
My master's degree final project. Code are adopted from various sources and documentation. 

This project is about doing text summarization using seq2seq architecture and attention mechanism. I used 2 datasets which are Amazon Food Text Reviews and News Summary. You can get the dataset from here https://github.com/sunnysai12345/News_Summary/blob/master/news_summary_more.csv and https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews.
